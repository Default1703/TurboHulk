# TurboHulk
TurboHulk - this is esoteric programming that ironizes current programming languages. The language generates bytecode, which is executed on the TVM (TurboVM) virtual machine.
By default, you need to display some kind of message in the console:
```javascript
function main() begin
    conclusion("turbo output")!
end
```
